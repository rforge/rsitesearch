Objects created and not deleted in one vignette are available to vignettes compiled later using "R CMD build" + "R CMD check".  However, when a vignette is compiled itself from within RStudio -- at least with R 3.3.0 on Mac OS X 10.11.4 -- objects from another vignette are not so available.  

In this vignette, the following "objects()" call always returns character(0), as we might expect.  "Object1", created on the next line appears when "vignette2confusedByObject1" is compiled using "R CMD build" + "R CMD check" but not when it is compiled itself from within RStudion:  

```{r}
objects()
Object1 <- 1
```
