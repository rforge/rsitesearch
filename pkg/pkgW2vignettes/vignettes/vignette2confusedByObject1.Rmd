Objects created and not deleted in one vignette are available to vignettes compiled later using "R CMD build" + "R CMD check".  However, when a vignette is compiled itself from within RStudio -- at least with R 3.3.0 on Mac OS X 10.11.4 -- objects from another vignette are not so available.  

To see this, note that the following line, "objects()", returns "Object1" when this vignette is built with "R CMD build" + "R CMD check" -- provided "Object1" is kept and not deleted in an earlier vignette, as in this toy "pkgW2vignettes" package.  However, when compiled by itself from within RStudio, this "objects()" call returns character(0):  

```{r}
objects()
Object2 <- 2
```
